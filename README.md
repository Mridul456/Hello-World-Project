# Hello-World-Project

✨ Today I wrote my very first “Hello World” program in Java! 🚀 It feels amazing to finally take the first step in learning Java and diving deeper into programming. This is just the beginning of my coding journey, and I’m really excited to explore more, build projects, and grow as a developer. 🌱💻
